# GovWifi User Signup API


This handles incoming sign-up texts and e-mails.

The private GovWifi [build repository][build-repo] contains instructions on how to build GovWifi end-to-end - the sites, services and infrastructure.

## Overview

### Journeys

With each journey, we generate a unique username and password for GovWifi.
These get stored and sent to the user.

- SMS signup - Users text a phone number and get a set of credentials.
- SMS help routes - Users can also ask for help from the same phone number and
  are sent some guides based on their selected operating system.
- Email signup - Users with a government domain email send a blank email to
  signup@wifi.service.gov.uk.
- Sponsor signup - Users with a government domain email address send through a
  list of email addresses and/or phone numbers to sponsor@wifi.service.gov.uk.

### Sinatra routes

- `GET /healthcheck` - AWS ELB target group health checking
- `POST /user-signup/email-notification` - AWS SES incoming email notifications
- `POST /user-signup/sms-notification/notify` - Notify incoming SMS notifications

## Performance Platform

This application sends statistics to the [Performance Platform][performance-platform] for volumetrics and completion rates via a Rake task. This Rake task is triggered by an ECS scheduled task.

### Send statistics manually

You can trigger statistics to be sent manually by running the command below locally.
Ensure that your ~/.aws/credentials is set up correctly.
Populate the date argument to the Rake task with the date that you want to send the statistics for.

#### Volumetrics

```shell
aws ecs run-task --cluster wifi-api-cluster --task-definition user-signup-api-task-wifi --count 1 --overrides "{ \"containerOverrides\": [{ \"name\": \"user-signup\", \"command\": [\"bundle\", \"exec\", \"rake\", \"publish_daily_statistics['2019-02-11']\"] }] }" --network-configuration "{ \"awsvpcConfiguration\": { \"assignPublicIp\": \"ENABLED\", \"subnets\": [\"subnet-XXXXXXX\", \"subnet-XXXXXXX\"],\"securityGroups\": [\"sg-XXXXXX\"]}}" --region eu-west-2 --launch-type FARGATE
```

#### Completion Rate

```shell
aws ecs run-task --cluster api-cluster --task-definition user-signup-api-task --count 1 --overrides "{ \"containerOverrides\": [{ \"name\": \"user-signup\", \"command\": [\"bundle\", \"exec\", \"rake\", \"publish_weekly_statistics['2018-05-03']\"] }] }" --region eu-west-2
```

## GDPR

### Inactive User Deletion

Any user who has not logged into GovWifi for more than 12 months is considered inactive.

We have a Rake task that runs daily with ECS Scheduled tasks to ensure this happens.

```shell
bundle exec rake delete_inactive_users
```

### Dependencies

- [GOV.UK Notify][notify] - used to send outgoing emails and SMS replies
- MySQL database - used to store generated credentials

## Developing

### Running the tests

```shell
make test
```

### Using the linter

```shell
make lint
```

### Serving the app locally

```shell
make serve
```

Then access the site at <http://localhost:8080/healthcheck>

### Deploying changes

Once you have merged your changes into master branch, deploying them is made up of
two steps:

- Pushing a built image to the docker registry.

- Restarting the running tasks so it picks up the latest image.
